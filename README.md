PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Parallelism in teaching classes is visible in many forms. An example of a one to many format is the 
lecture. Another example is students who work individually on their assignments. However, in 
teaching there is one specific situation that is still not in a parallel format yet. That situation is 
created when presentation are mandatory. This results in a time consuming bottleneck in the process 
of teaching. One of the standard settings is where students in turn give a presentation on their work 
for their fellow students. This is especially time consuming if the presentations are held by novice 
speakers. Hopes are then, that the group is able to fulfil a sounding board function and is able to give 
proper unbiased quantitative and qualitative feedback. But, most of the time the audience consists 
also of novices.

-------------------------------

PROJECT GOALS

The goal is to develop a system able to give feedback usable for performance improvement of novice 
speakers on verbal and nonverbal skills. Through the interpretation of one or all of the following 
components: pose, gesture, prosody, intonation, pitch and speech rate performance grades should 
be given related to a predefined rubric and metrics (comparable with text editor generated 
readability statistics).
